Callback Functions and Event Listeners in JavaScript
===========================================================

This topic is a crucial part of the Namaste JavaScript Series, focusing on callback functions, blocking the main thread, and event listeners in JavaScript.

1\. Understanding Callback Functions
------------------------------------

A callback function in JavaScript is a function passed as an argument to another function, allowing asynchronous programming. Callback functions enable handling asynchronous tasks within a synchronous environment.

Examples:

*   SetTimeout: `setTimeout(callback, 5000);`
*   Event Listeners: `document.getElementById('clickMe').addEventListener('click', callbackFunction);`

2\. Blocking the Main Thread
----------------------------

Blocking the main thread in JavaScript can occur when synchronous code takes too long to execute, causing the user interface to freeze. As JavaScript is single-threaded, blocking operations can degrade performance.

3\. Dive into Event Listeners
-----------------------------

Event listeners in JavaScript are functions that wait for a specific event to occur and then execute a callback function. They are crucial for handling user interactions and building interactive web applications.

Example:

    document.getElementById('clickMe').addEventListener('click', callbackFunction);

4\. Demo in Dev Tools
---------------------

Using browser developer tools, you can observe how callback functions and event listeners work behind the scenes. The call stack, closures, and lexical scope play essential roles in understanding JavaScript execution.

5\. Garbage Collection and Memory Management
--------------------------------------------

Removing event listeners is essential for memory management in JavaScript. Failure to remove event listeners can lead to memory leaks, slowing down web applications and causing performance issues.

These notes provide a comprehensive overview of callback functions and event listeners in JavaScript, laying the groundwork for understanding event loops in the next topic of the series.
