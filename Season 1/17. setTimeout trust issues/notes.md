setTimeout has trust issues
===========================

In JavaScript, the `setTimeout` function does not always execute exactly after the specified time interval. This uncertainty in timing is often referred to as "trust issues" with `setTimeout`.

Understanding the Concurrency Model in JavaScript
-------------------------------------------------

*   When JavaScript code runs, a global execution context is created and placed in the call stack.
*   Code is executed line by line, starting with the global execution context.
*   `setTimeout` registers a callback function in the web API environment and starts a timer.
*   JavaScript does not wait for the timer to complete and continues executing the next line of code.
*   If there are a large number of lines of code to execute, the global execution context remains busy until all the code is executed.

Behavior of setTimeout in a Busy Call Stack
-------------------------------------------

*   Even if the timeout expires while the call stack is busy executing other code, the callback function is already posted in the callback queue.
*   The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty to process events from the callback queue.
*   The callback function from `setTimeout` is executed only after the call stack becomes empty.

Implications and Best Practices
-------------------------------

*   **Concurrency Model:** JavaScript's single-threaded nature with event-driven asynchronous operations allows for efficient execution but requires careful consideration of timing.
*   **Avoid Blocking the Main Thread:** Blocking the main thread with synchronous code prevents other events from being processed, impacting performance and user experience.
*   **Understanding Timing Guarantees:** While `setTimeout` does not guarantee exact timing, it ensures that the callback will not be executed before the specified time.
*   **Use Cases for setTimeout:** Consider deferring less critical code execution using `setTimeout` to prioritize more important tasks on the main thread.

Example Code:
-------------

Below is an example demonstrating the behavior of `setTimeout` in a busy call stack:

    // Example code
    console.log("Start of execution...");
    
    // Registering a callback function with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Callback executed after timeout.");
    }, 5000);
    
    // Simulating a busy call stack with a loop
    const startDate = new Date();
    let endDate = new Date();
    while (endDate - startDate < 10000) {
      endDate = new Date();
    }
    
    console.log("End of execution.");

Conclusion
----------

Understanding the behavior of `setTimeout` and the JavaScript concurrency model is essential for effective development and troubleshooting. By being aware of timing issues and optimizing code execution, developers can create smoother and more responsive web applications.
