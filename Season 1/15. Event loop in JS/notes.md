JavaScript Event Loop and Microtasks
====================================

Understanding the JavaScript event loop and microtasks is crucial for mastering asynchronous programming. Here's a breakdown of the concepts:

Event Loop Overview
-------------------

The event loop is a fundamental mechanism in JavaScript that manages the execution of asynchronous tasks. It ensures that the JavaScript engine remains responsive by handling tasks asynchronously.

### Main Components:

*   **Call Stack:** Stores the execution context of synchronous tasks.
*   **Callback Queue:** Stores callback functions from asynchronous tasks like setTimeout and DOM events.
*   **Microtask Queue:** Stores microtasks with higher priority, such as promises and mutation observers.

Microtask Queue
---------------

The microtask queue has higher priority than the callback queue. Functions from promises and mutation observers are placed in this queue.

### Execution Process:

1.  JavaScript engine executes synchronous code and pushes tasks onto the call stack.
2.  If a microtask is encountered, it's added to the microtask queue.
3.  Once the call stack is empty, the event loop checks for microtasks and moves them to the call stack for execution.
4.  Microtasks are executed in FIFO order.

Starvation
----------

If a microtask continually generates new microtasks, callback functions in the callback queue may never get executed. This scenario is known as starvation.

Conclusion
----------

Understanding the event loop and microtasks is essential for writing efficient asynchronous JavaScript code. It ensures proper handling of tasks and prevents issues like starvation.

For more in-depth understanding, further research and study are recommended.
