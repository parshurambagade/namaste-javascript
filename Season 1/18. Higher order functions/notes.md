Higher Order Functions
======================

In JavaScript, the best part of functional programming is facilitated by higher-order functions. Functional programming, although vast, can be understood through smaller examples.

Introduction to Higher Order Functions
--------------------------------------

A higher-order function is one that either takes another function as an argument or returns a function. This concept is essential for functional programming.

### Example of a Higher Order Function

For instance, a function that takes another function as an argument:

    function y(x) {
      console.log(x);
    }
    
    function Namaste() {
      console.log("Namaste!");
    }
    
    y(Namaste); // Here, y is the higher-order function
    

Understanding the Essence
-------------------------

The essence lies in understanding that functions can be treated as first-class citizens in JavaScript, enabling the creation of higher-order functions. This flexibility allows for powerful programming techniques.

### Importance in Interviews

In coding interviews, demonstrating proficiency in writing modular, reusable, and functional code is highly valued. Breaking down logic into smaller, functional units showcases coding prowess.

### Implementing Higher Order Functions

By abstracting logic into smaller functions, code becomes more modular and reusable. Functions like `map` are examples of higher-order functions that facilitate this approach.

Conclusion
----------

Mastering higher-order functions is fundamental for writing efficient, maintainable, and expressive code in JavaScript. It enhances code readability, promotes reusability, and demonstrates proficiency in functional programming paradigms.
